# Vitacompanion

Vitacompanion is a user module which makes developing homebrews for the PS Vita device easier. It does two things:
- Open a FTP server on port 1337
- Listen to commands on port 1338

# Build

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Install

Run VitaShell on your PS Vita, press SELECT to activate the FTP server and copy `vitacompanion.suprx` to `ur0:/tai`. Finally, add the following line to `ur0:/tai/config.txt`:

```
*main
ur0:tai/vitacompanion.suprx
```

# Usage

## FTP server

You can upload stuff to your vita by running:
```
curl --ftp-method nocwd -T somefile.zip ftp://IP_TO_VITA:1337/ux0:/somedir/
```
Or you can use your regular FTP client.

## Command server

Send a command by opening a TCP connection to the port 1338 of your Vita.

For example, you can reboot your vita by running:
```
echo reboot | nc IP_TO_PSVITA 1338
```

Note that you need to append a newline character to the command that you send. `echo` already adds one, which is why it works here.

Thanks to xerpi for his [vita-ftploader](https://bitbucket.org/xerpi/vita-ftploader/src/87ef1d13a8aa/plugin/?at=master) plugin, I stole a lot of his code (with his permission). Thanks to cpasjuste for [PSP2SHELL](https://github.com/Cpasjuste/PSP2SHELL), it inspired me to create this tool.
